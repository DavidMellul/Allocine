# Allocine

An attempt at creating a chatbot for Allocine & Gaumont Pathé using Puppeteer.

## Part 1

This is the first part of the process, as I explain in this article : <a href="https://medium.com/@davidmellul/creating-a-chatbot-to-book-cinema-shows-part-1-9c13de573a07">Creating a chatbot to book cinema shows - Part 1</a>

## Install

Just copy paste those lines :

```
  git clone https://github.com/DavidMellul/Allocine.git
  cd Allocine
  npm install puppeteer
  npm install readline-sync
  node main.js
```

(Sorry, I didn't have the courage to run a npm init :cry: )
